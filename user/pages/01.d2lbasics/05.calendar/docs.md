> Find the calendar tool by clicking the date at the top of any screen, under the "Course Tools" tab, or "My Home" screen when you first log in.



The calendar is automatically populated by dates that you set in the following tools: [DropBox], [Course Content], [Quizzes], [Checklists], [Surveys], [Grades], and [Discussions].

* Calendar events display notifications in the D2L [Pulse App] 
* You can change multiple content dates at the same time using the offset feature.
* You can bulk offset multiple dates or all dates for a new term or another section of the course with the [Manage Dates] tool.
* You can subscribe to calendars or import calendars using a Microsoft Outlook [iCal feed].
