As the instructor you can add and remove students from your D2L ClassList.

### Enroll a User
1. From the ClassList click the *Add Participant* button and then *Add Existing User* ![add a course participant](classlistaddparticipant.PNG)
2. Using the *Add Existing Users* search box we are going to search for the name or username of the person to add to our course (the username is the most efficient) ![ad an existing user](classlistaddexistinguser.PNG)
3. Once you've found the user you want to add - check the box to the left of their name and set their *role* in the course.  **Be careful** to ensure that you add a student with the role of student and not as an instructor in your course. With these same directions if you want to add another instructor to edit content in your course.
